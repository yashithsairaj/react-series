## Simple Password Generator Project

### Project Overview

The password generator project features the following functionalities:

- **Password Generation**: Users can generate random passwords of varying lengths using a slider input. The passwords include both uppercase and lowercase letters.

- **Auto-Generation**: The project automatically generates an initial password when the component loads. Additionally, it dynamically updates the password whenever the slider value is adjusted or a character is included/excluded.

- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can easily copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click. The project provides a smooth user experience by automatically selecting the password text for copying.

### Learning Objectives

Through this project, we'll delve into several key concepts and practices in React development:

- **Lifecycle Methods**: We'll explore how to execute code when the component mounts and update it in response to user interactions.

- **State Management**: Understanding state management in React, especially in handling dynamic UI elements like the password generation process.

- **Event Handling**: Managing events efficiently and optimizing event-driven functionality to enhance user experience.

- **Optimization Techniques**: We'll learn about memoization and how to optimize repetitive function executions to improve app performance.

### Approach and Methodology

While the project primarily focuses on React functionality, we'll use Tailwind CSS for styling.

### **Hooks**

**react** hooks used in this project

- [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) : useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.
- [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) : useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
- [useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) : useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
- [useRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) : useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

### Getting Started with the Project

To begin, let's set up the project and dive into the development process:

- Initialize a new project using the latest version of Vite.

```bash
npm init vite@latest 02passwordgenerator -- --template react
cd 02passwordgenerator
npm install
```

-installing Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
```
