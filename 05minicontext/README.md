## A Simple Context API Project

**Introduction:**
This documentation explores advanced data handling techniques in React, focusing on efficient management of props, state, and the Context API.

**Core Components:**

- **Props:** Used for passing data from parent to child components.
- **State:** Represents the internal state of a component.
- **Context API:** Facilitates global state management in React applications.

**Solution: State Management with Context API:**
The Context API provides a centralized data store accessible from any component in the application, eliminating the need for prop drilling.

**Implementation Steps:**

- **Create a Context:** Define a context using React's createContext() function.
- **Provide the Context:** Use a Context Provider component to make the context available to all components within a specific scope.
- **Consume the Context:** Utilize the useContext() hook or the Context.Consumer component to access the global state within individual components.

**Benefits:**

- **Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for prop drilling, resulting in cleaner and more efficient code.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates scalable data management in large React applications.
- **Simplicity:** Simplifies data handling by providing a centralized approach to state management.

### Getting Started with the Project

To begin, let's set up the project and dive into the development process:

- Initialize a new project using the latest version of Vite.

```bash
npm init vite@latest 05miniContext -- --template react
cd 05miniContext
npm install
```

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
